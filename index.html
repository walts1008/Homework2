      <p>Hey, how's it going? My name is Walter St-Aude and I'd like to welcome you to my page. This page is designed to showcase my skills and abilities as a fullstack developer learned through the Bootcamp Program at UPenn.</p>

      <p>Allow me to share a little more about myself. I was born in Brooklyn, New York and moved to Philadelphia in about the second grade. Completed middle and high school and went on to further my education at the Community College of Philadelphia where I initially majored in computer information systems then switched to Behavioral Health/Psychology. I then transferred to Virginia Tech in Blacksburg Virginia to continue my education. I moved back to Philadelphia and have worked in an array of fields from sales & marketing, to customer service to behavioral health. I'm looking forward to transitioning to a newer and more lucrative field with the completion of this program.</p>

      <p>Please feel free to explore the site and see what I have to offer. If you have any questions or concerns do not hesitate to check out the contact page. Inquiries will be responded to in a timely manner. Thank you!.</p>
